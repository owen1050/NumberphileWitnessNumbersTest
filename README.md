# NumberphileWitnessNumbersTest
This is some basic python which will run lots of witness tests to find the witnesses who lie the most
I think it is working correctly? Not entirely sure. 

Feel free to make pull requests to improve upon it. Right now there are no checks on N or a overlapping,
and it can probably be more efficient  

You can change the starting and ending N to test your own ranges, as well as change the a range.

when 131<n<30000 and 2<a<128 these are the worst witness

a: 125  lies:0.5% of the time, or 68 out of 14934 tests
a: 32   lies:0.5% of the time, or 69 out of 14934 tests
a: 68   lies:0.5% of the time, or 73 out of 14934 tests
a: 16   lies:0.5% of the time, or 76 out of 14934 tests
a: 64   lies:0.7% of the time, or 107 out of 14934 tests
